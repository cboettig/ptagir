## ABOUT PTAGIS

> The Columbia Basin PIT Tag Information System (PTAGIS) is the centralized database for PIT-tagged fish in the Columbia River Basin. PTAGIS provides custom software for contributors to collect tagging and interrogation data, manages the database, and coordinates with fishery agencies and organizations. In addition, PTAGIS collects automated detection data and designs, installs, and maintains the equipment that records those detections. All data contributed to and collected by PTAGIS are freely available through this website.
